## Location

The API is available at ` https://devmailer.netlify.app/`. Responses are sent as JSON.

## Summary objects

When retrieving a list of objects, an abbreviated or summary version of that object is returned - i.e., a subset of its attributes. To get a full detailed version of that object, fetch it individually.

## HTTP Verbs

The DevMailer API uses HTTP verbs appropriate to each action.

| Verbs  | Description          |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieving resources |
| POST   | Creating resources   |
| PUT    | Updating resources   |
| DELETE | Deleting resources   |

## Error

If an error occurs, whether on the server or client side, the error message(s) will be returned in as object. For example:

> Status Code: 400

```JSON
    {
        "message": "Please provide the required fileds",
        "stack": null
    }
```
